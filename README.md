# JJJay11-Trans-VGG-for-Landslide-Detection

This is an algorithm (Trans-VGG) that combines multi-channel data for landslide detection. The input data can be customised, and the program that combining Trans-VGG model will adaptively construct the dataset and train the model based on the input data. The well-trained model can be used for landslide detection. Due to the large size of the dataset, it can be available from the corresponding author with reasonable request. It is noting that the obtained data cannot be used for commercial purposes.
